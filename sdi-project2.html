<p>This was a tough week for me personally, We had a major system crash over the weeked and I spent half the week trying fix it. I choose that story to tell this one.</p>
<p>Apparently at around 8:30 PM Saturday evening our facility was struck by lightening, Causing an outage. Now our system is designed in such a way that when there's an outage we get a phone call. The problem is the numbers they had on file were for the depot and we don't usually work on Saturday. Needless to say we didn't find out about the outage until Sunday.</p>
<p>So we began the cycle of traveling nightly to our next nearest facility, over 5 hours round trip, everynight. It was brutal! </p>
